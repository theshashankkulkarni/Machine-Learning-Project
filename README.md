# Dataset Overview
This dataset provides information about various stores belonging to a supermarket chain. These supermarkets are large self-service outlets offering a broad range of food, beverages, and household goods. They are more extensive than traditional grocery stores but smaller and with a more limited selection than hypermarkets or big-box stores. In the U.S., the terms "supermarket" and "grocery store" are often used interchangeably to describe these outlets.

# Dataset Details
The data includes metrics for different supermarket stores, each identified by a unique positive integer as their Store ID.

- Store ID: Unique identifier for each store.
- Store_Area: The physical size of the store in square yards.
- Items_Available: The total number of different items that the store stocks.
- Daily_Customer_Count: The average number of customers visiting the store per month.
- Store_Sales: The total sales generated by the store in U.S. dollars.
